# Streamlining Our API and Enhancing User Experience

We've made significant improvements by centralizing our API calls, which simplifies our codebase and enhances maintainability. Additionally, we've introduced features like a global 401 interceptor for better handling of unauthorized requests and added support for multi-tenant environments with tenant-prefixed API routes, ensuring a smoother experience for all users.
