# Streamlined Lead Forms for Better User Experience

We've made some significant updates to our lead forms to enhance usability and organization. Now, empty parent fields will be preserved when filtering values on save, ensuring no important information gets lost. Additionally, we've revamped the layout of lead form inputs into responsive rows, making it easier for users to navigate and fill out forms.
