# Streamlining User Experience with New Features and Fixes

We've made significant updates to enhance user experience, including the introduction of a 410 Gone response for deprecated API endpoints and a refined parent-child hierarchy for profile fields. Additionally, we've addressed various issues related to user roles, data type enforcement, and tenant-specific access, ensuring a more secure and organized platform for all users.
