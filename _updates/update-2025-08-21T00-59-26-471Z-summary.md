# Project Update: API Enhancements and Refactoring

This week, we've implemented a new 410 Gone response for removed API endpoints related to profile field groups and have successfully closed Issue #49, ensuring that profile field data types are now enforced correctly. Additionally, we've refactored the legacy profile field groups, moving to a more efficient parent-child field hierarchy.
