# Introducing User Invitations and Enhanced Membership Management

We've rolled out a user invitation system complete with an admin UI and acceptance flow, making it easier to onboard new members. Additionally, we've added membership management endpoints with role-based access controls, a dedicated management page, and comprehensive documentation to support these features. These updates are designed to streamline user management and enhance your experience.
