# Recent Project Updates

We've made significant progress with our project, including the implementation of user and membership models along with database migrations. Multi-tenant support has been added for company and user scoping, and we've also introduced user-scoped access control with JWT authentication. Additionally, we've implemented isolation tests to ensure the integrity of leads, notes, profiles, and recommendations.
