# Recent Code Updates

We've made several key updates recently, including a migration of frontend API calls to a centralized client and the addition of a global 401 interceptor for unauthorized requests. Tests have also been updated for tenant-scoped endpoints, and new features like stateful lead management and tenant-prefixed API routes have been implemented.
